    # Advanced Spline 3D Course: API Configuration & Cross-Platform Development
    
    ## Session 2 Learning Points:
    
    ### 1. Cross-Platform API Integration
    - Configure APIs for both Apple platforms (iOS/macOS) and Android platforms
    - Ensure weather widgets work consistently across all platforms
    - Implement responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
    - Handle platform-specific API endpoints and authentication
    - Optimize performance for mobile devices vs desktop
    
    ### 2. Advanced API Configuration Interface
    - Use Spline's built-in API configuration panel
    - Navigate between Variables, Webhooks, and APIs tabs
    - Create new APIs with descriptive naming conventions (e.g., "LUCA")
    - Configure GET requests with proper URL structure
    - Set up data retrieval endpoints: https://api.example.com/userAPI
    - Implement proper error handling and response validation
    
    ### 3. Progressive API Development Workflow
    - Start with simple data display (weather temperature)
    - Progress to complex API configuration and management
    - Implement real-time data updates and refresh mechanisms
    - Add user interaction and feedback systems
    - Scale to handle multiple data sources and endpoints
    
    ### 4. UI/UX Design Evolution
    - Dark theme for professional API configuration interfaces
    - Blue accent colors for interactive elements and CTAs
    - Clear visual hierarchy with tabs and organized sections
    - Intuitive button placement and labeling
    - Consistent iconography and visual language
    
    ### 5. Data Integration Best Practices
    - RESTful API design patterns
    - Proper URL structure and endpoint naming
    - JSON data handling and transformation
    - Caching strategies for performance optimization
    - Error handling and graceful degradation
    
    ### 6. Advanced Technical Concepts
    - Webhook integration for real-time updates
    - Variable management for dynamic content
    - API versioning and backwards compatibility
    - Security considerations for API keys and authentication
    - Rate limiting and performance optimization
