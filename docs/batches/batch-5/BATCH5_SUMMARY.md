2. **Experience Phase (Weeks 5-8)**: Transform user interface
3. **Productivity Phase (Weeks 9-12)**: Add dynamic tool system
4. **Independence Phase (Weeks 13-16)**: Complete OpenAI replacement

### Dependency Management
```
Video Training (PATCH 1) → Self-Training (PATCH 2) → Chat UI (PATCH 3) → Tool Panels (PATCH 4) → LLM System (PATCH 5)
```

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Technical Achievements
