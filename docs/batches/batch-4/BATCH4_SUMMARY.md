## Batch Overview

Batch 4 represents the final phase of AGENT development, focusing on achieving 100% production deployment readiness. Building on the successful completion of Batch 3 (which delivered core platform features and training infrastructure), Batch 4 addresses the remaining 2.8% of requirements needed for full production launch.

### Key Focus Areas
1. **Production Environment Setup** - Complete dependency management and environment configuration
2. **Real Training Data Integration** - Replace mock data with actual training sources
3. **Comprehensive Quality Assurance** - Achieve â‰¥90% test coverage and security validation
4. **Production Deployment & Monitoring** - Final launch with full operational monitoring
