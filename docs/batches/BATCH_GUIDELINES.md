# Batch Guidelines

## What is a Batch?
A batch is a major release or feature set that includes:
- New major features
- Version releases
- Architecture changes
- Major refactoring
- Multi-component updates

## Batch Workflow

### 1. Create Batch Folder
```bash
mkdir docs/batches/batch-{n}
```

### 2. Required Files
Each batch folder must contain:
- `BATCH{n}_CHECKLIST.md` - Comprehensive task list
- `BATCH{n}_SUMMARY.md` - Release notes and impact analysis

### 3. Batch Numbering
- Start with `batch-1` and increment sequentially
- Align with version numbers when applicable

### 4. Checklist Template
Each checklist should include:
- [ ] Requirements gathered
- [ ] Architecture designed
- [ ] Core components implemented
- [ ] Integration completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] Documentation completed
- [ ] Testing comprehensive
- [ ] Deployment verified
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

### 5. Summary Template
Each summary should include:
- **Objectives**: What the batch aimed to achieve
- **Features**: New capabilities added
- **Changes**: Major modifications made
- **Performance**: Benchmark results
- **Breaking Changes**: API or behavior changes
- **Migration**: Upgrade instructions
- **Known Issues**: Current limitations

## Best Practices
- Plan batches around major milestones
- Include comprehensive testing
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Provide migration guides
- Coordinate cross-team dependencies
