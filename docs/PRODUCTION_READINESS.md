## 🔧 Production Launch Checklist

### **Phase 1: Dependency & Environment Setup**
- [ ] **Install Production Dependencies**
  ```bash
  pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4 nltk scikit-learn numpy pandas transformers
  ```
- [ ] **Configure Environment Variables**
  - API keys for training sources
  - Database connections
  - Security tokens
- [ ] **Verify Python Environment**
  - Resolve externally-managed-environment issues
  - Set up proper virtual environment

### **Phase 2: Training System Integration**
- [ ] **Real Training Sources Configuration**
  - Replace mock data with actual website crawling
  - Configure content selectors for each domain
  - Test API rate limits and error handling
- [ ] **RAISE Framework Integration**
  - Connect training pipeline with full AGENT core
  - Verify domain specialist updates
  - Test knowledge persistence and retrieval
- [ ] **Training Automation**
  - Schedule periodic retraining (daily/weekly)
  - Implement incremental knowledge updates
  - Set up training progress monitoring

### **Phase 3: Quality Assurance**
- [ ] **Test Coverage Verification**
  ```bash
  npm run test:coverage
  # Target: ≥ 90% coverage
  ```
- [ ] **Integration Testing**
  - Test all mode layouts with real data
  - Verify wallet authentication flows

### **Phase 4: Production Deployment**
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Validation**
  ```bash
  # Test Kilo pipeline deployment
  git push origin main
  # Verify: lint → test → build → deploy
  ```
- [ ] **Security Audit**

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **1. Environment & Dependencies** (Critical)
```bash
# Set up proper Python environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-training.txt
```

### **2. Real Training Integration** (High)
- Configure actual training sources (MDN, React docs, trading sites, legal resources)
- Test end-to-end training with real data
- Verify AGENT knowledge improvements post-training

### **3. Test Coverage & Quality** (High)
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:coverage
npm run lint
npm run build
```

### **4. Production Deployment** (Medium)
