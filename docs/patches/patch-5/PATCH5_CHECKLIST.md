## Technical Requirements

### Performance Monitoring Stack
```typescript
// Performance metrics configuration
interface PerformanceConfig {
  messageLoadTime: number;
  scrollPerformance: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  networkLatency: number;
}
```

### Technology Stack
- **Virtual Scrolling**: React Window for efficient list rendering
- **Caching**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js for local storage
- **Performance**: Web Vitals API for metrics collection
- **Compression**: LZ-string for message compression
- **Search**: Lunr.js for full-text search indexing
- **PWA**: Workbox for service worker management

### Security Considerations
- Cache encryption for sensitive messages
- Secure IndexedDB storage with encryption keys
- Performance data anonymization
- Memory leak prevention strategies
- Safe service worker implementation

## Default CLI Flags (non-interactive)

### Performance Dependencies
```bash
# Add performance optimization dependencies
npm install react-window react-window-infinite-loader \
  dexie lz-string lunr workbox-webpack-plugin \
  --save --no-interactive

# Add performance monitoring dependencies
npm install web-vitals @types/web-vitals \
  performance-observer-polyfill \
  --save --no-interactive
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start development with performance monitoring
npm run dev:performance --no-interactive

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance --no-interactive

# Analyze bundle size
npm run analyze:bundle --no-interactive
```

## Integration Points
