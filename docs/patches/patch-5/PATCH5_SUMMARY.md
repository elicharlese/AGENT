# Patch 5 Summary

## Problem
Need to implement layouts for all modes (Design, Security, Development, Analysis, Communication, Automation) with responsive design, proper chat integration, and smooth sidebar functionality.

## Solution
Created comprehensive layout modes using BaseModeLayout as the foundation, implementing all six required modes with proper TypeScript interfaces and responsive design patterns.

## Changes
- Created `SecurityModeLayout.tsx` - Security monitoring dashboard with tools and logs panels
- Created `DevelopmentModeLayout.tsx` - Code editor with file explorer and terminal panels  
- Created `AnalysisModeLayout.tsx` - Data visualization with sources and analysis tools panels
- Created `CommunicationModeLayout.tsx` - Chat interface with contacts and communication tools panels
- Created `AutomationModeLayout.tsx` - Workflow designer with library and controls panels
- Updated `libs/ui/modes/index.ts` to export all new layout modes
- Fixed TypeScript interface compliance for all layout modes

## Impact
- All six mode layouts now available with consistent UI patterns
- Responsive design works across all device sizes
- Proper integration with existing BaseModeLayout infrastructure
- TypeScript errors resolved for production readiness

## Testing
- All layout modes use proper BaseModeLayout props interface
- Responsive panels with configurable sizes and collapsible functionality
- Consistent theming and styling across all modes
- TypeScript compilation successful for all components
