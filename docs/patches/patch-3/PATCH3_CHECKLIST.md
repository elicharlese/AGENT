# Patch 3 Checklist - Chrome Extension for Job Proposal Autofill (Not Implemented)

## Summary

### STATUS: PLANNED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED

This patch describes a planned Chrome extension that would mirror Simplify.jobs functionality for automatic form filling and job tracking. The extension would integrate with the AGENT /app for comprehensive job management and proposal automation. However, this extension has not yet been implemented in the codebase.

### Core Components

1. **Form Detection Engine** - Identifies job application forms
2. **Autofill Service** - Populates forms with user data
3. **Job Tracker** - Manages application status and history
4. **AGENT Integration** - Syncs with main app backend
5. **Template Engine** - Generates customized proposals

- [ ] Field mapping logic
- [ ] Template generation system
- [ ] Data validation functions
- [ ] API integration methods

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Extension popup functionality
- [ ] Content script injection
- [ ] Background service worker
- [ ] AGENT backend communication
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

### E2E Tests

- [ ] Complete application flow on major job boards
- [ ] Data sync between extension and main app
- [ ] User profile management

## Technical Requirements

### Chrome Extension Manifest V3

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "AGENT Job Autofill",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "scripting",
    "background"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*.linkedin.com/*",
    "https://*.indeed.com/*",
    "https://*.workday.com/*"
  ]
}
```

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Chrome Extension plugin
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (matching main app theme)
- **State Management**: Zustand or Context API
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage API + IndexedDB
- **Communication**: Chrome Runtime API + WebSocket to AGENT

### Security Considerations

- Content Security Policy compliance
- Secure data transmission to AGENT backend
- User data encryption in local storage
- Permission minimization principle
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests

## Default CLI Flags (non-interactive)

### Chrome Extension Project Setup

```bash
# Create Chrome extension app in Nx workspace
nx g @nx/react:app chrome-extension \
  --directory=apps/chrome-extension \
  --bundler=vite \
  --style=css \
  --routing=true \
  --unitTestRunner=vitest \
  --e2eTestRunner=playwright \
  --no-interactive

# Add Chrome extension specific dependencies
npm install --save-dev @crxjs/vite-plugin chrome-types
npm install zustand webextension-polyfill
```

### Build Configuration

```bash
# Vite config for Chrome extension
nx g @nx/vite:configuration chrome-extension \
  --uiFramework=react \
  --no-interactive
```

## Integration Points

### AGENT Backend API Endpoints

- `POST /api/jobs/track` - Track new job application
- `GET /api/jobs/user/{userId}` - Get user's job applications
- `PUT /api/jobs/{jobId}/status` - Update application status
- `POST /api/proposals/generate` - Generate AI proposal content
- `GET /api/user/profile` - Get user profile for autofill

### Main App Integration

- Job dashboard in `/app/jobs` route
- Profile management in `/app/profile`
- Analytics dashboard in `/app/analytics`
- Settings integration in `/app/settings`

## Success Metrics

### Functionality Metrics
- [ ] Successfully detects forms on 95% of major job boards
- [ ] Autofill accuracy rate > 98%
- [ ] < 2 second form completion time
- [ ] Zero data loss during sync operations
- [ ] 100% uptime for background processes

### User Experience Metrics

- [ ] One-click application submission
- [ ] Seamless AGENT app integration
- [ ] Intuitive popup interface
- [ ] Responsive design across screen sizes
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with hot reload
- Mock job board pages for testing
- AGENT backend integration testing
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

### Production Deployment

- Chrome Web Store submission
- Automated build and packaging
- Version management and updates
- User feedback collection system
- Performance monitoring and analytics

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Job board changes**: Implement flexible selectors and fallbacks
- **Browser updates**: Regular compatibility testing and updates
- **Rate limiting**: Implement respectful scraping practices
- **Data privacy**: Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance

### Business Risks

- **Competition**: Focus on AGENT integration differentiator
- **User adoption**: Comprehensive onboarding and documentation
- **Maintenance**: Automated testing and monitoring systems

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] User installation and setup guide
