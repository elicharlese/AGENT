## Technical Requirements

### Security Technology Stack
```typescript
// Security configuration interface
interface SecurityConfig {
  encryptionAlgorithm: 'AES-256-GCM' | 'ChaCha20-Poly1305';
  keyDerivation: 'PBKDF2' | 'Argon2';
  sessionTimeout: number;
  mfaRequired: boolean;
}
```

### Technology Stack
- **Encryption**: Signal Protocol with libsignal-protocol-typescript
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or custom JWT with refresh tokens
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) or AWS KMS
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, custom security dashboard
- **Compliance**: Custom GDPR/CCPA compliance engine
- **Backup**: Encrypted backup with AES-256 encryption

### Security Considerations
- Zero-trust architecture implementation
- Defense-in-depth security strategy
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Incident response and disaster recovery plans
- Security awareness training for development team

## Default CLI Flags (non-interactive)

### Security Dependencies
```bash
# Add security and encryption dependencies
npm install @signalapp/libsignal-client \
  bcryptjs jsonwebtoken crypto-js \
  helmet express-rate-limit \
  --save --no-interactive

# Add compliance and monitoring dependencies
npm install @sentry/node @sentry/react \
  audit-log winston \
  --save --no-interactive
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start development with security monitoring
npm run dev:secure --no-interactive

# Run security tests
npm run test:security --no-interactive

# Run vulnerability scan
npm run scan:vulnerabilities --no-interactive
```

## Integration Points
