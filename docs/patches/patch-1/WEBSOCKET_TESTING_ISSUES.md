# WebSocket Testing Issues

## Overview

This document summarizes the issues encountered while testing the WebSocket hook implementation for Patch 1 validation.

## Current Status

The WebSocket hook tests are currently failing with the following issues:

1. **Connection Status Issue**: The `isConnected` state is not being properly updated in tests, remaining `false` even after simulating the `onopen` event.

2. **Null Reference Error**: Attempts to send messages result in `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'send')` because `wsRef.current` is null.

## Root Causes

1. **Asynchronous Connection**: The WebSocket connection process is asynchronous, but the tests are not properly waiting for the connection to be established before trying to use it.

2. **Mock Implementation**: The WebSocket mock is not properly simulating the connection process, particularly the timing of when the `wsRef.current` is set.

3. **Effect Timing**: The `useEffect` hook that calls `connect()` may not be completing before the test assertions are made.

## Attempts Made

1. **Async Waiting**: Added `await act(async () => { await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10)); })` to wait for the useEffect to run.

2. **Mock Updates**: Ensured the mock WebSocket object has all the necessary properties and methods.

3. **Event Simulation**: Properly simulate the `onopen` event to trigger the connection state update.

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Hook Implementation**: Review the actual WebSocket hook implementation to understand how the connection is established and how `wsRef.current` is set.

2. **Improve Mock Strategy**: Create a more sophisticated mock that better simulates the actual WebSocket API behavior.

3. **Add Debugging**: Add console.log statements to the hook and tests to understand the timing of events.

4. **Consider Alternative Testing Approaches**: Look into using libraries like `ws` for more realistic WebSocket testing or consider end-to-end testing with a real WebSocket server.

## Impact on Patch 1 Validation

The failing tests are preventing full validation of the WebSocket functionality for Patch 1. However, manual testing has confirmed that the WebSocket integration is working correctly in the actual application.
