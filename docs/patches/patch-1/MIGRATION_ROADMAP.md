# Frontend Migration Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

The current frontend implementation consists of:
1. Static HTML files (index.html, admin.html, etc.)
2. Vanilla JavaScript (app.js) with:
   - WebSocket connections for real-time chat
   - Authentication flow
   - UI event bindings
   - Chat message handling
   - Security tools integration
   - Network monitoring

## Migration Goals

1. Migrate from vanilla JS to React + Tailwind CSS
2. Implement Nx workspace structure
3. Add Zod-based runtime validation
4. Improve test coverage to ≥90%
5. Implement proper routing via Nx app layouts
6. Maintain all existing functionality

## Phase 1: Nx Workspace Setup

### Tasks:
- [ ] Initialize Nx workspace with React preset
- [ ] Create web application under apps/
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Set up shared libraries in libs/
- [ ] Configure build and development scripts

### Timeline: 2 days

## Phase 2: Component Architecture Design

### Tasks:
- [ ] Identify UI components from current implementation
- [ ] Design component hierarchy
- [ ] Create component specifications
- [ ] Plan state management approach
- [ ] Design authentication flow in React

### Components to Migrate:
1. **Sidebar Component**
   - Collapsible navigation
   - Domain selection
   - System monitoring indicators

2. **Chat Interface Component**
   - Message display area
   - Input field with auto-resize
   - Typing indicators
   - Message formatting

3. **Authentication Component**
   - Login modal
   - Session management
   - Token handling

4. **Security Tools Component**
   - Port scanning interface
   - Network monitoring dashboard
   - Training data submission

5. **Notification System**
   - Toast notifications
   - System messages

### Timeline: 3 days

## Phase 3: React Implementation

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement core components
- [ ] Add state management (Context API or Redux)
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Integrate WebSocket connections
- [ ] Add responsive design with Tailwind
- [ ] Implement routing with Nx

### Timeline: 5 days

## Phase 4: Validation and Testing

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add Zod validation for forms and API responses
- [ ] Implement unit tests for components
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests
- [ ] Achieve ≥90% test coverage

### Timeline: 4 days

## Phase 5: CI/CD and Deployment

### Tasks:
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up automated testing
- [ ] Implement deployment verification
- [ ] Document deployment process

### Timeline: 2 days

## Total Timeline: 16 days

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Functionality Loss**: Maintain parallel implementation during migration
2. **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize React components
3. **Testing Gaps**: Implement tests incrementally with development
4. **Deployment Issues**: Use staging environment for validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] React + Tailwind implementation complete
- [ ] Nx routing working correctly
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] ≥90% test coverage achieved
- [ ] Zod validation implemented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational
- [ ] Successful deployment verification
