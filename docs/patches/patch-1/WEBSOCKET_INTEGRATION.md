# WebSocket Integration for Patch 1

## Overview

This document describes the WebSocket integration implemented for Patch 1 of the AGENT iMessage chat application. The integration enables real-time messaging between the frontend and backend, providing a seamless chat experience.

## Implementation Details

### WebSocket Hook (`hooks/use-websocket.ts`)

The `useWebSocket` hook manages the WebSocket connection and provides functions for interacting with the WebSocket server:

- **Connection Management**: Automatically connects to the WebSocket server when the hook is initialized and handles disconnection
- **Authentication**: Authenticates with the WebSocket server using a Supabase JWT token
- **Message Handling**: Receives and processes incoming messages from the server
- **Conversation Management**: Provides functions to join and leave conversations
- **Message Sending**: Provides functions to send chat messages and typing indicators

### Chat Window Integration (`components/chat/chat-window.tsx`)

The chat window component has been updated to use the `useWebSocket` hook:

- **Connection Status**: Displays the WebSocket connection status
- **Message Sending**: Uses the `sendChatMessage` function to send messages
- **Message Receiving**: Displays incoming messages from the WebSocket
- **Conversation Joining**: Automatically joins conversations when the component mounts

## WebSocket Message Types

### Client to Server

- `authenticate`: Sent when connecting to authenticate the user
- `join_conversation`: Sent to join a conversation
- `leave_conversation`: Sent to leave a conversation
- `send_message`: Sent to send a chat message
- `typing`: Sent to indicate the user is typing

### Server to Client

- `authenticated`: Sent when authentication is successful
- `message`: Sent when a new chat message is received
- `typing`: Sent when another user is typing

## Testing

Tests have been created for the WebSocket hook but are currently failing due to issues with the test environment and mocking strategy. Further debugging is required to get the tests passing.

## Next Steps

1. Debug and fix the WebSocket hook tests
2. Implement additional error handling and reconnection logic
3. Add support for more WebSocket message types as needed
4. Optimize performance for high-volume message traffic
