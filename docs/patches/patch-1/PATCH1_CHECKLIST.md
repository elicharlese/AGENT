# Patch 1 Checklist

## Summary

This patch focuses on implementing a fully functional chat application interface that can work with both real-time public chat and AI chat functionality. The implementation will extend the existing frontend in the static directory rather than creating a new Nx workspace.

## Features to implement

- Real-time public chat interface using WebSocket technology
- AI chat interface that integrates with the existing AGENT model
- Enhanced message UI with support for different message types
- File attachment functionality for messages
- Domain switching capability (Developer, Trader, Lawyer, etc.)
- Authentication integration with the existing login system
- Mobile-responsive design that works across devices

## To-Do / Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing frontend structure in static/ directory
2. Extend index.html with chat functionality
3. Enhance app.js to support real-time messaging

4. Create WebSocket integration for public chat

5. Connect frontend to existing AGENT API endpoints

6. Implement domain switching in the chat interface

7. Add file attachment functionality

8. Ensure mobile responsiveness

9. Test authentication flow

10. Verify integration with all domain agents

## Tests to Write

- Unit tests for WebSocket connection handling

- Integration tests for AGENT API endpoints

- UI tests for domain switching functionality

- File attachment validation tests

- Authentication flow tests

- Responsive design tests across different screen sizes

## Default CLI Flags (non-interactive)

- Nx workspace template:
  `npx create-nx-workspace myrepo \
    --preset=react-ts \
    --appName=web \
    --style=css \
    --defaultBase=main \
    --no-interactive`
- Expo mobile/web app:
  `nx g @nx/expo:app mobile --no-interactive`
