## Technical Requirements

### Admin Technology Stack
```typescript
// Admin configuration interface
interface AdminConfig {
  rolePermissions: Record<string, string[]>;
  moderationRules: ModerationRule[];
  auditLogRetention: number;
  maxBulkOperations: number;
}
```

### Technology Stack
- **Admin Dashboard**: React Admin or custom dashboard with real-time updates
- **Role Management**: RBAC with granular permissions
- **Content Moderation**: AI-powered content filtering + manual review
- **Analytics**: Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live admin notifications
- **Audit Logging**: Structured logging with search capabilities

### Security Considerations
- Admin session timeout and re-authentication
- IP whitelisting for admin access
- Two-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Encrypted audit logs with tamper detection
- Admin action approval workflows for critical operations

## Default CLI Flags (non-interactive)

### Admin Dependencies
```bash
# Add admin and moderation dependencies
npm install react-admin @mui/x-data-grid \
  chart.js react-chartjs-2 \
  socket.io-client \
  --save --no-interactive

# Add security and logging dependencies
npm install express-rate-limit helmet \
  winston audit-log \
  speakeasy qrcode \
  --save --no-interactive
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start development with admin interface
npm run dev:admin --no-interactive

# Run admin functionality tests
npm run test:admin --no-interactive

# Generate admin documentation
npm run docs:admin --no-interactive
```
