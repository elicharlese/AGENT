# Patch 7 Summary: Spline Designer Training System

## Problem
AGENT lacked 3D design capabilities, limiting its creative potential to 2D content. Users needed the ability to generate high-quality 3D scenes, animations, and interactive experiences as part of a comprehensive creative workflow.

## Solution
Implemented a complete Spline Designer training system that enables AGENT to:
