# Patch 2 Checklist - LLM Architecture Elevation

## Summary
Elevate the AGENT LLM design by implementing robust backend connections (Python and Rust), creating comprehensive architecture documentation, and updating the model design for enhanced knowledge base integration.

## Features to implement

| Feature | Size | Goal ref | Description |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| Python Backend Connection Optimization | M | END_GOAL.md - Knowledge Base Integration | Ensure clean, robust Python backend connections for LLM/knowledge base operations |
| Rust Backend Connection Implementation | L | END_GOAL.md - Performance Optimization | Implement high-performance Rust backend connections for LLM processing |
| LLM Self-Care Architecture Documentation | M | END_GOAL.md - Documentation | Create `/docs/architecture/llm_self_care.md` with comprehensive model design |
| RAISE Framework Integration | L | END_GOAL.md - AI Agent Framework | Implement RAISE framework components (Reasoning, Acting, Iterating, Synthesizing, Evaluating) |
| Knowledge Base Connection Layer | M | END_GOAL.md - Knowledge Management | Create clean abstraction layer for knowledge base operations |
| LLM Model Configuration System | S | END_GOAL.md - Configuration Management | Implement flexible model configuration and switching |

## To-Do / Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Connection Optimization
- [ ] Audit current Python backend connections
- [ ] Implement connection pooling and error handling
- [ ] Create Rust backend connection layer
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and logging

### Phase 2: Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive `llm_self_care.md` documentation
- [ ] Document RAISE framework integration
- [ ] Create system architecture diagrams
- [ ] Document API interfaces and data flows

### Phase 3: Model Integration
- [ ] Implement RAISE framework components
- [ ] Create knowledge base abstraction layer
- [ ] Add model configuration system
- [ ] Implement self-monitoring and optimization

## Tests to Write
- [ ] Python backend connection tests
- [ ] Rust backend integration tests
- [ ] Knowledge base operation tests
- [ ] RAISE framework component tests
- [ ] Model configuration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Default CLI Flags (non-interactive)
- Nx workspace template:
  `npx create-nx-workspace myrepo \
    --preset=react-ts \
    --appName=web \
    --style=css \
    --defaultBase=main \
    --no-interactive`
- Expo mobile/web app:
  `nx g @nx/expo:app mobile --no-interactive`

## Architecture References
- RAISE Framework (from provided images)
- ReAct (Reason + Act) pattern implementation
- Knowledge base integration patterns
- Multi-language backend architecture (Python + Rust)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All backend connections are robust and performant
